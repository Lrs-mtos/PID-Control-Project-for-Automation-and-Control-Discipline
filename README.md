# PID-Control-Project-for-Automation-and-Control-Discipline
A PID control project developed for the Automation and Control discipline using Arduino. This project demonstrates the use of controller coefficients (Kp, Ki, and Kd) to control a motor's position using an encoder. The code implements the PID control algorithm and allows adjusting the coefficients dynamically using buttons.
